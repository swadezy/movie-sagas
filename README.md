# Project Name

Movie Sagas

## Description

For this project, I was tasked with taking a partially built movie list webapp and adding additional functionality and styling.  Starting work not from a blank slate but from some partially completed state was an interesting challenge and one that I'm sure is much more common in the actual workplace - taking stock of what routes were already built, what the SQL queries were actually getting, etc, was the first hurdle.  The webapp initially only displayed the movie list to client and nothing really more. Once I had a good understanding of what needed to be done, I added a details view for each movie, an edit function within that details view as well as a delete route, the ability to add new movies, a search query on the main page, and a genre filter on the main page.  The biggest challenge by far wasn't these functional pieces but getting Material UI to behave the way I wanted it to.  This was my first time using Material UI, and something like aligning inputs and buttons was much trickier for me than writing the SQL queries to filter by partial strings.  I'm fairly satisfied with the final product but will be digging much further into Material UI from here on out so it doesn't feel quite as much like I'm trying to wrangle a wild beast to get my app to look prettier.
